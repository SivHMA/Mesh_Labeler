Mesh Labeler2 â€“ User Manual
==========================

Created by [Tai-Hsien Wu](https://github.com/Tai-Hsien) at the Ohio State University.

This project is mainly based on [Visualization Toolkit (VTK)](https://vtk.org/) and, especially, [vedo](https://github.com/marcomusy/vedo).

This program is originally developed to conveniently label/annotate dental mesh model. It can also work on any other type of mesh model.

------------
Current version: 2.0

------------

1.  Download portable version from
    <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FmUJS8F0opBWxfte7yVgSTkTfnOHj6oe/view?usp=sharing>

2.  Extract ZIP file, and there will be a folder named
    **Mesh_Labeler2_portable**. Execute **Mesh_Labeler.exe** to open the program. It might take a few seconds to launch (sometimes longer). 
	
3. 	Once the program is launched, you will see the user interface, as shown below.

4.  Use the bottom-right button **Load** to open a mesh file. Currently, the program supports VTP
    (with an attribute named **Label** , a cell scalar array) and STL, OBJ, and PLY files. There are four examples (Example_01.vtp, Example_02.stl, Example_03.obj, and Example_04.ply) that you can download via my github.
	Note: For those files that do not contain attribute **Label** (e.g., STL, OBJ, PLY), the program will initially generate a cell scalar array called **Label** 
    and assign 0 (i.e., all background) to the array for each cell
    (i.e., for each triangle) after loading them. The screenshot after loading a VTP with the cell arrary **Label** will look like below.

![Figure 2. After loading a suitable VTP file, you can see the model in the center of the window.](./figure2.jpg)

5.  From Version 2, users can define the the number of labels, label color, and label description by themselve. To do it, please modifiy the **colormap.csv** in the folder **Mesh_Labeler2_portable**, which is a CSV file containing five columns: Label, R, G, B, Descriptions.
	Please keep the headers as the default file. Each row corresponds a label.

6.  The view on the scene can be changed by using various mouse actions, as
    follows:

-   Rotating the mouse wheel upwards will zoom in, and downwards will zoom out.

-   Holding the middle mouse button down and dragging will pan the scene or
    translate the object.

-   Holding the left mouse button down and dragging will rotate the camera/actor
    in the direction moved.

7.  There are two methods to annotate a mesh. User can go for each method by select the tab. Different methods have different input under their tabs.

-   Spline Method: Change label by selecting cells (triangles)

The simplest way to select cells is to right-click on a cell. The selected cells are highlighted by grey color. Right-click on a selected cell can cancel its selection.
An advanced way to select cells is to press "s" to enter "Spline model", where you can add points by left click on the mesh. Once you decide to use the selected points (number of points should be larger than 2) to generate a spline, press "Enter". All cells within this spline will be highlighted.
 Press "c" to clean the current selection. Before you execute the change, please make sure the *active label* is what you plan to apply. The default *active label* is 0. You can change it throguth the spinBox under the Spline tab.
When you satisfy the selection, press "e" to execute the change which will assign the value of *active label* on those selected cells. Please follow the colormap to assign/fix the label of each cell for the mesh.

-   One-Way Swap Method: Change all cells with a specific label one-shot

In this way, we can entirely change cells from one label to another label.
There are two spinBoxs (i.e., *Original label* and *New label*) under the One-Way Swap tab. Once they are all set, click **Change!** button; then, all cells with the original label will be changed to be the new label.

8.  Once everything is done, you can save the result by using the **Save** button. The default extension file is **VTP**, which will save the result in the VTP format with the cell array **Label**.
	If the extension file is **STL** or **OBJ**, Mesh Labeler will save each label to an individual **STL** or **OB** file. For example, a 15-class mesh model will output 15 STL files.
